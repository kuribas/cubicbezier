Removing overlap from bezier paths in haskell
=============================================

This literate programming document serves as both the description 
and code for the algorithm for removing overlap and
performing set operations on bezier paths.  It can be used both for
understanding the code, and for porting the used algorithm to other 
implementations.

**Note on porting**: Porting should be fairly straightforward. 
However some care must be taken with regards to lazyness.  Often
many variables inside the `where` statement aren't
evaluated in all guards, so it's important to evaluate only those
which appear in the guards.  This library uses copying instead of 
mutation, but for the most part mutation can be used as well.
It uses the `lens` library for modifying state.  The following translation
could be made to a mutable language: 

  * reading state:
    - `view field struct`: `struct.field`
    - `get`: `state` (implicit state, usually sweepstate)
    - `use field`: `state.field`

  * writing state:
    - `set field value struct`: `struct.field = value`
    - `field .= value`: `state.field = value` (typically sweepstate)

  * modifying state:
    - `over field fun struct`: `struct.field = fun (struct.field)`
    - `modify fun`: `state = fun state`
    - `modifying field fun`: `state.field = fun (state.field)`

Let's begin with declaring the module and library imports:

> module Geom2D.CubicBezier.Overlap
>        (boolPathOp, union, intersection, difference,
>         exclusion, FillRule (..))
>        where

#endif

The basic idea is to keep curves where one side is inside the filled
region, and the other side is outside, and discard the rest. 
Since that could be true only of a part of the curve, I also need to
split each curve when it intersects
another curve.  How to know which side is the inside, and which
side the outside?  There are two methods which are use the most: the
[*even-odd rule*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule)
and the [*nonzero rule*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule).
Instead of hardwiring it, I use higher-order functions to determine
when a turnratio is inside the region to be filled, and how the
turnratio changes with each curve.

Checking each pair of curves for intersections would work, but is
rather inefficient.  I only need to check for overlap when two curves
are adjacent.  Fortunately there exist a good method from
*computational geometry*, called the *sweep line algorithm*.  The 
idea is to sweep a vertical line over the input, starting from
leftmost point to the right (of course the opposite direction is also
possible), and to update the input dynamically.  I keep track of each
curve that intersects the sweepline by using a balanced tree of
curves.  When adding a new curve, it's only necessary to check for
intersections with the curve above and below.  Since searching on the
tree takes only `O(log n)` operations, this will save a lot of
computation.

The input is processed in horizontal order, and after splitting curves
the order must be preserved, so an ordered structure is needed.  The
standard map library from `Data.Map` is ideal, and has all the
operations needed.  This structure is called the *X-structure*,
since the data is ordered by X coordinate.:

> type XStruct = M.Map PointEvent [Curve]

I use `PointEvent` instead of just `Point`.  This way I can have a `Ord`
instance for the map, which must match the horizontal ordering.  A
newtype is ideal, since it has no extra cost, and allows me to define
a Ord instance for defining the relative order.  The value from the
map is a list, since there can be many curves starting from the same
point.

> newtype PointEvent = PointEvent DPoint
>
> instance Show PointEvent where
>    show (PointEvent (Point px py)) = printf "(%.5g, %.5g)" px py

When the x-coordinates are equal, use the y-coordinate to determine
the order.

> instance Eq PointEvent where
>   (PointEvent (Point x1 y1)) == (PointEvent (Point x2 y2)) =
>     (x1, y1) == (x2, y2)
>
> instance Ord PointEvent where
>   compare (PointEvent (Point x1 y1)) (PointEvent (Point x2 y2)) =
>     compare (x1, y2) (x2, y1)

All curves are kept left to right, so I need to remember the
curve direction for the output:

The curves intersecting the sweepline are kept in another balanced
Tree, called the *Y-structure*.  *These curves are not allowed to
overlap*, except in the endpoints, and will be ordered vertically.
The `Curve` datatype defines the ordering of the curves,
and adds additional information.  The `turnRatio` field is the
turnRatio of the area to the left for a left to right curve, and to
the right for a right to left curve.  The `changeTurn` function
determines how the turnRatio will change from up to down.  This
together with a test for the *insideness* of a certain turnratio,
allows for more flexibility.  Using this, it is possible to generalize
this algorithm to boolean operations!

The curveRank parameter is used to memoize the order in the Ystruct.
This will avoid costly comparisons for tree rebalancing etc...

The FillRule datatype is used for the exported API:

> data FillRule = EvenOdd | NonZero

> data Curve = Curve {
>   _bezier :: !(CubicBezier Double),
>   _turnRatio :: !(Int, Int),
>   _changeTurn :: !((Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)),
>   _curveRank :: Maybe (Ratio Integer)}
>
> trOne :: (Int, Int)
> trOne = (0,0)
>
> between :: Ratio Integer -> Ratio Integer -> Ratio Integer
> between a b = a +(b-a)/2
> 
> makeLenses ''Curve
>
> instance Show Curve where
>   show (Curve (CubicBezier (Point p0x p0y) (Point p1x p1y)
>               (Point p2x p2y) (Point p3x p3y)) (t1, t2) _ o) =
>     printf "Curve (%.5g, %.5g) (%.5g, %.5g) (%.5g, %.5g) (%.5g, %.5g) (%i,%i) %s" 
>     p0x p0y p1x p1y p2x p2y p3x p3y t1 t2 (show o)
> 
> type YStruct = S.Set Curve

The total state for the algorithm consists of the X-structure, the
Y-structure, and the output found so far.  I use a trick to make
access to curves above and below the current pointevent more
convenient.  I use two sets to represent a focus point into the
Y-structure, where the left set are the elements less than the
pointEvent (above), and the right set the elements greater (below):

> data SweepState = SweepState {
>   _output :: !(M.Map PointEvent [CubicBezier Double]),
>   _yStruct :: !YStruct,
>   _focusPoint :: DPoint,
>   _xStruct :: !XStruct}
>                   
> makeLenses ''SweepState

> singularC :: Point Double -> Curve
> singularC p = Curve (CubicBezier p p p p) trOne id Nothing

This handy helper function will pass the first curve above to the
given function, and if it doesn't return `Nothing`, remove it from the
state.  It does nothing when there is no curve above.

>                 return $ Just x

The same with the curve below.

>                 yStructDel (i+1)
>                 return $ Just x

`splitYStruct` changes the focus and returns and removes any curves which end in
the current pointEvent:

> splitYStruct :: DPoint -> SweepStateM [Curve]
> splitYStruct p = do
>   yStr <- use yStruct
>   focusPoint .= p
>   traceMessage $ "CHANGEFOCUS " ++ showPt p
>   traceMessage "MSG Remove curves ending at pointevent from Y structure" 
>   let lStr = fst $ S.split (singularC p) yStr
>       rightCurves = takeWhile (\c -> cubicC3 (_bezier c) == p) $
>                     S.toDescList lStr
>       nR = length rightCurves
>       i = S.size lStr - nR
>   replicateM_ nR (yStructDel i)
>   return rightCurves
>

=== Some functions on the Sweep state:

>   return str
>   (p, c) <- zoom xStruct $ state M.deleteFindMin
>   traverse_ (traceMessage . ("XSTRUCTREM " ++) .
>              showCurve . view bezier) c
>   str <- use xStruct

> yStructIndex :: Curve -> YStruct -> Int

> yStructDel i = do

>   traceMessage $ "YSTRUCTREM " ++ showCurve (view bezier $ S.elemAt i str)
>   yStruct .= S.deleteAt i str
>

Insert the curve into the Y structure.  First lookup the position of
the curve, then calculate the rank of the curve, using the surrounding
elements.  Insert the curve using the rank.  This will avoid repeating
expensive operations.

To compare curves vertically, take the the curve which starts the
rightmost, and see if it falls below or above the curve.  If the first
control points are coincident, test the last control points instead,
or the midpoint.  This works because if the first point is coincident
the curves shouldn't intersect except in the endpoints (see #splitAndOrder).
To lookup a single point, I use a singular bezier curve.

Compare a point with a curve.  See if it falls below or above the hull
first.  Otherwise find the point on the curve with the same
X-coordinate by iterating.

=== Comparing against the hull {#hull}

Compare a point against the convex hull of the bezier.  `EQ` means the
point is inside the hull, `LT` below and `GT` above.  I am currently
only testing against the control points, some testing needs to be done
to see what is faster.

Preprocessing
-------------

Since the algorithm assumes curves are increasing in the horizontal
direction they have to be preprocessed first.  I split each curve
where the tangent is vertical.  If the resulting subsegment is too
small however, I just adjust the control point to make the curve
vertical at the endpoint.

I also do snaprounding to prevent points closer than the tolerance.

main loop
---------

For the main loop, I remove the leftmost point from the
X-structure, and do the following steps:

  1. Split any curves which come near the current pointEvent.

  2. Send all curves to the left of the sweepline to the output, after
  filtering them based on the turning number.

  3. For each curve starting at the point, split if it intersects with
the curve above or the curve below.  Sort resulting curves vertically.
If there are no curves starting from point, test the curves above and
below instead.  Adjust the turnRatios for each curve.

  4. Insert the points in the Y structure.

  5. Loop until the X-structure is empty

Filter and output the given curves.  The `isInside` function
determines the *insideness* of a give turnratio.  For example for the
nonzero-rule, this would be `(> 0)`.  This inserts the curve into the
output map.

Test for intersections and split: (#splitAndOrder)
--------------------------------------------------

Since the curves going out of the current pointEvent in the X-structure are
unordered, they need to be ordered first.  First they are ordered by
first derivative.  Since it's easier to compare two curves when they
don't overlap, remove overlap, and then sort again by comparing the
whole curve.

To do this, I implemented a monadic insertion sort.  First the curves are split
in the statemonad, then they are compared.

> splitAndOrder :: Double -> [Curve] -> SweepStateM [Curve]
> splitAndOrder tol curves =
>   sortSplit tol $
>   sortBy compDeriv curves
>
> compDeriv :: Curve -> Curve -> Ordering
> compDeriv (Curve (CubicBezier p0 p1 _ _) _ _ _)

>
> slope (Point 0 0) = 0
> slope (Point x y) = y/x


Insertion sort, by splitting and comparing.  This should be efficient
enough, since ordering by derivative should mostly order the curves.

Handle intersections of the first curve at point and the curve
above. Return the curves with updated turnratios.  Some care is needed
when one of the curves is intersected at the endpoints, in order not
to create singular curves.

curves overlap.

=== Find curve intersections

Test if both curves intersect.  Split one or both of the curves when
they intersect.  Also snapround each point, and make sure the point
of overlap is the same in both curves.

Given a list of intersection parameters, split at the next
intersection, but don't split at the first or last control point, or
when the two curves are (nearly) coincident.  Note that list of
intersections is read lazily, in order not to evaluate more
intersections that necessary.

The intersection point can be in the past (if the curve is nearly vertical), so if that happens move the intersection point a tiny bit aside.  We may need to reorient the subcurve after the intersection point as well (see adjustSplit).

=== Check if curves overlap.

If the curves overlap, combine the overlapping part into one curve.
To compare the curves, I first split the longest curve so that the
velocities in the first control point match, then compare those curves
for equality.

Curves can be combined if they are equal, just by composing their
changeTurn functions.

=== Testing beziers for approximate equality {#eq}

If the control points of two bezier curves are within a distance `eps`
from each other, then both curves will all so be at least within
distance `eps` from each other.  This can be proven easily:
subtracting both curves gives the distance curve.  Since each control
point of this curve lies within a circle of radius `eps`, by the
convex hull property, the curve will also be inside the circle, so the
distances between each point will never exceed `eps`.
